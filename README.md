#Orange Theory Fitness Data Analysis

### Description

The purpose of this project was to analyze my Orange Theory data collected from March 2019 to March 2020.  The main metrics used for analysis included calories burned and # of minutes of the class spent with my heart rate above a specified threshold.  This project exists in 3 forms: 
- Excel dashboard (started in late 2019 and still maintained)
- Tableau dashboard (started in late 2019 and still maintained)
- R Shiny App (started in mid 2020 and no longer maintained)


The goal was to identify patterns in my exercise data that could lead me to find the ideal Orange Theory workout, but nothing of great interest was found in the analysis.  Now, the remaining dashboards are maintained to keep up and track my progress against self-identified fitness goals.
